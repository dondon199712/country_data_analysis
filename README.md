# Country Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes data related to countries, using Python libraries like pandas and scikit-learn. 
The Jupyter Notebook included here  explores the data and performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify key factors affecting the data. 

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.
2. Open the `country_analysis.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Make sure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.).
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis.
